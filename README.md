# Hi, I’m Hope 🛡️

**Aspiring SOC Analyst | Threat Detection | Blue Team**

I’m building hands-on experience in threat detection, log analysis, and Windows security hardening through practical labs and documented investigations.

My path into cybersecurity hasn’t been linear — and that resilience shows in how I approach security work: calm, methodical, and persistent.

I focus on understanding the *why* behind alerts, not just closing tickets.

### 🔧 Core Focus

* Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
* Microsoft Sentinel (KQL Hunting & Analysis)
* Windows Event Logs & Sysmon
* DISA STIG Remediation
* Structured Incident Documentation

## 🎯 Career Direction

Building toward a SOC Analyst role where I can:

* Investigate alerts independently
